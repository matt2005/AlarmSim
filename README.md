# Hold ups

I tried getting a working alrm howver after 5 attempts i gave up for a bit after feeling deflated and it felt like i was the only person in the world doing this.

--2019
Get another alarm, hopefully this one will work so i can proceed further



# Idea
My idea is to use an ATTiny85 linked to a MCP2025.
## Update
Possibly use an esp8266/esp32 instead of attiny85

# BOM

ATTiny85 - purchased in 2015
MCP2025-330E - purchased in 2015
